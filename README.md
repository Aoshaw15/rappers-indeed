# rappers-indeed
This project is meant to showcase a simple fullstack application. User can search a rapper's name and what returns is the rapper's birth name, age, and birth location. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, GIT

Since this is my first fullstack application, I hard coded the rapper's information so the options are limited for the time being. I used javascript to set up the ability to retrieve information when the user pressed a button on my html page. Express and Node were used to test each stage to make sure the correct progress was being made and eliminate potential bugs in the system. Once completed, everything was pushed to Github using GIT.  
## Optimizations

This application was built with a limited list of options. My goal for future applications is to eliminate such features and allow the user to add and search whatever rapper they desire. 


## Lessons Learned:

Many many lessons were learned during this project. I hadn't used Express or node really before this project. There was a lot of syntax for commands that needed to be looked up. Also the general idea of how fullstack applications work was a huge hurdle to overcome to get the project to work properly.
